Comprehensive Report on Handgames Python Code
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The provided Python code presents two interactive hand games, Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) and Hand Cricket (HC), incorporating MySQL database connectivity. Additionally, a graphical representation using the Turtle module signals the end of the game with a Game Over screen.

1.2 Purpose
The primary aim of the code is to offer users an engaging gaming experience, incorporating classic games with user interaction and database storage. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the code structure, design choices, modules used, and the flow of the games.

2. Code Overview
2.1 Modules Used:
mysql.connector:

Purpose: To connect Python with a MySQL database.
Usage in Code: Establishing a connection (mysql.connector.connect()) and executing queries (mycursor.execute()).
random:

Purpose: Generating random choices for both computer players.
Usage in Code: Generating random integers for computer choices in both RPS and HC games.
turtle:

Purpose: Provides a simple drawing interface for creating a Game Over screen.
Usage in Code: Creating a graphical representation of the end of the game.
2.2 Design Choices:
Game Structure:

The code is structured into two main sections, each implementing a different hand game: RPS and HC. Both games follow a sequential flow from game initiation to completion, involving user inputs, game logic, and database interactions.
Database Integration:

MySQL is used to store player information, scores, and game outcomes. Tables 'RPS' and 'HC' capture data for Rock-Paper-Scissors and Hand Cricket, respectively.
Graphical Game Over Screen:

The Turtle module is utilized to draw a visually appealing "Game Over" screen upon completing the games, enhancing the user experience.
